- Production logging

### Option 3: Manual Daemon Mode
```bash
python wallie_voice_bot.py
```
Direct daemon execution for advanced users.

## üó£Ô∏è How to Interact with Wallie

### Wake Words
Wallie responds to these built-in wake words:
- **"picovoice"** (recommended - most reliable)
- "computer"
- "jarvis" 
- "alexa"
- "hey google"
- "ok google"

### Voice Interaction Pattern
1. **Say the wake word**: "picovoice"
2. **Wait for confirmation**: Listen for audio feedback
3. **Speak your request**: Ask questions or give commands
4. **Listen to response**: Wallie will speak the answer

### Example Interactions
```
You: "picovoice"
Wallie: [wake word detected sound]
You: "What's the weather like today?"
Wallie: "I'm an offline assistant, so I can't check current weather..."

You: "picovoice"  
Wallie: [wake word detected sound]
You: "Tell me a joke"
Wallie: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"

You: "picovoice"
Wallie: [wake word detected sound]  
You: "What time is it?"
Wallie: "The current time is 3:45 PM"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "No audio devices found"
**Solution**: Check microphone/speaker connections, restart audio services

**Issue**: "Wake word not detected"  
**Solution**: Speak clearly, ensure microphone volume is adequate, try "picovoice" wake word

**Issue**: "Slow response times"
**Solution**: Ensure GPU drivers are updated, close other GPU-intensive applications

**Issue**: "Daemon fails to start"
**Solution**: Run `python check_system.py` to verify all dependencies

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check system requirements
python check_system.py

# Test individual components  
python debug_workers.py

# Verify imports and models
python test_import.py

# Check daemon initialization
python test_daemon_init.py

# Test queue communication
python test_worker_functionality.py
```

## üìà Performance Optimization
